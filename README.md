Basic operations on MupenRR recordings. Like the editor in STROOP but hopefully scriptable.

# Operations

mupenmanip stat run.m64 - Summary of run.m64

mupenmanip frames run.m64 - Frame-by-frame breakdown of every frame of run.m64

mupenmanip cut run.m64 out.m64 begin end - Cuts every frame except for ones from begin to end from run.m64 and saves to out.m64

mupenmanip concat run1.m64 run2.m64 run3.m64 - Merges all listed files into a single run.
